Originating from our agency background, we've catered to clients with unique requirements. Over time, we realized we were repeatedly solving the same challenges: whether it was crafting a full-fledged solution, integrating with existing systems, enhancing inventory connectivity, offering agent portals for CRM expansion, introducing social interactions to headless sites, or establishing workflows for seamless system integration.

## Enter Kanvas:
Born from the need to streamline these repetitive tasks, Kanvas Niche offers a set of headless modules tailored to accelerate the development of headless applications. We've encapsulated our years of experience into these modules, addressing the common hurdles we face daily in app development. At the same time providing a flexible admin interface to manage all these features.

## What Kanvas Niche Offers:
- **Ecosystem**: Dive into authentication and teams (or multi-tenant) management.
- **Inventory**: Manage products, their variants, and distribution channels efficiently (marketplace sites).
- **Social**: Engage with features like follows, comments, reactions, and messaging (social media apps).
- **CRM**: Navigate through leads, deals, and pipelines with ease (seller portal , client portals).
- **Workflow**: Seamlessly connect your app with other systems.
